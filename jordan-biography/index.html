      </br>
      <p>Michael Jordan is a former professional American basketball player, Olympic athlete, businessperson and actor. Considered one of the best basketball players ever, he dominated the sport from the mid-1980s to the late 1990s. 

        Jordan led the Chicago Bulls to six National Basketball Association championships and earned the NBA's Most Valuable Player Award five times. With five regular-season MVPs and three All-Star MVPs, Jordan became the most decorated player in the NBA.</p>

      </br>
      <p>Jordan further surprised the sports world by signing a Minor League Baseball contract with the Chicago White Sox on February 7, 1994.[90] He reported to spring training in Sarasota, Florida, and was assigned to the team's minor league system on March 31, 1994.[91] Jordan has said this decision was made to pursue the dream of his late father, who had always envisioned his son as a Major League Baseball player.</p>
